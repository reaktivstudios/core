# The Reaktiv Way
At Reaktiv, we solve challenging technical problems to create solutions for clients that are custom fit for their needs. We stay true to our message to clients:Â *bring your biggest ideas to light*.

That work benefits greatly from a shared set of objectives and goals. As a development team, we want these goals to be plainly stated and easily actionable. Not all of these goals will be important all the time and to provide greater focus, we will meet occasionally to prioritize a group of goals that further our overall objective:


ðŸ’¡ We want toÂ **build high quality sites**Â asÂ **efficiently as possible**Â and continue toÂ **expand on what we know**

This plugin is a collection of utilities, best practices, and documents that form the bedrock of our approach to building websites.

## Local Environment Setup

Clone the repository to the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your local instance.

Run the following commands:

```
composer install
npm install
npm run docs:serve
```

## Updating Documentation

Documentation for this site lives alongside the code for Foundation, Reaktiv's utility plugin that underpins most of the work that we do.

To update this doc, either:
1. Add a document direclty to the a category inside of the `docs` directory of the repo, or
2. Add a markdown document anywhere in the repo, with a name that matches the class or file it refers to. This will be automatically collected and added to the "guides" categrory of this site on deploy.
